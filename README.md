# ScrapingWithMongo

Final product located at https://scrapingwithmongo.herokuapp.com/

This app scrapes medium.com/technology for their latest articles, using such packages as Cheerio, Mongoose, and Request. From here, I use AJAX requests/Express routes to allow the user to comment, delete those comments, save, and unsave articles.
